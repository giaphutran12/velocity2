Yes this is possible  I ask because we are a family of 4 with a large breed dog, and to come back and work for say 3-6 months and pay rent would be incredibly difficult with the cost of rent these days, not to mention the fact that we have a large dog with us as well, so our selection is verrrrry limited on who would even let us rent from them. - Agree, I have 2 dogs myself.  What kind of dog do you have?   \n\nLike I said, I will have full time work right away and will have minimum 100k down right away, and when our house in Mexico sells we would be getting between $500-600k in additional funds, of which we would obviously put straight down on whatever mortgage we have.   This will help with a large down payment as it plays a big part in affordability ratios.   When is your first day at work?  Will you be on probation?  I have helped clients who had no work and was on probation.    It just really depends on the overall situation. \n\nWe’ve talked to one other broker who mentioned us possibly being able to have a higher rate mortgage, with higher payments for the first 6 months or something, which we would choose over renting if that’s the only option..it’s just our biggest obstacle is coming back to Canada, we will have nowhere to stay for the time period needed to provide proof of income on a traditional mortgage.   Are you still working with the broker?  We work with many lenders from A lender, B lenders and private lenders.   There are many options.    Would you like to find a place and have it ready to move in when you arrive?  Or do you want to start shopping when you arrive.   Your situation is unique.   Are you willing to pay for rent for  a month or so?  It will give you some time to find a place in person?   It really depends on the loan to value ) how much down payment and if there is equity.  The broker is probably suggesting to go through a private lender till your work settles and then switch after 3 to 6 months.  It's really best to discuss over the phone. \n\nI will mention that we *might* have my father in law as an option for a co-signer on a mortgage, but we haven’t fully discussed that with him yet and we would ideally prefer, if possible, to do this on our own.   I can look at options on your own first, if needed, we can add your father in law as a co signer or a guarantor.   I understand that you want to try on your own first.  Only makes sense, it's a challenge when adding co signers or when family is involved. \n\nColleen said you were the best and I’ve been friends with her for 10 years, so I’m hoping there’s something that can be done with you here, somehow..someway.    So sweet, thank you for the kind words.  Colleen is awesome. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and any additional info you may need to paint a better picture.    Please let me know when is a good time for you to further discuss.  When do you start your new job?  Which company and what position?  Will your husband be working as well?   \n\nThank you in advance,","dateCreated":"2023-09-13T13:44:43.76"},{"text":"SV- setting up time to finish

The main point they singled out is the fact that the property was listed at $1.6MM for 168 days in March 2022 and then cancelled and has now transacted for $3.075MM, nearly more than $1.0MM over assessed value. Given the valuation risk, the maximum they are comfortable with offering on the subject lot is $1.1MM, on the condition that Nitesh can produce documented evidence of the proceeds to complete on the purchase, and a copy of the deposit to be paid on completion a condition precedent. \n\nFor clarity, this tentative offer would leave any non-subject property out of the financing and would not have any construction financing component - it is just to complete on the purchase.

Hi Michelle and Jorge, \n\n\nThank you for your patience.    I will send you a seperate document request email as I need to see how much income I can declare for you Michelle for your self-employed business. \nI suggest we pull credit towards the end of the month or beginning of November as the rate is value for 90-120 days.  \nCredit reports are valid for 30 days but as low as I submit your file to a lender, we are ok.  ( They may request to pull another one but if your credit is fine, you should be ok) \n\nRates starting 5.79% ( this can drop which we will be able to get) \nWith a 1% lender fee ( 1% on the borrowed amount which goes to the lender) \n\n\nIf we get an approval and the rates drop, we can ask for the rate decrease. \n\n\nAlso, just a few questions:\n\nWhen will you guys have a signed purchase contract?\nClosing date is Jan 2025?  Do you have a date?\n\nDown payment breakdown:\n\nSale of property $1 million\nGifted funds $250,000.   - Are the funds in Canada now if not where are they coming from?   When will the funds be in your account?  \nIs your current home on the market now?\n\nThe reason I am asking is there are many changes in the mortgage industry and we have to ensure and answer all questions for the lenders.   \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts or do you prefer to do this sooner?   \nIn order to submit your file, the lender will require a signed copy of the purchase agreement.   \n\n\nLet's discuss more when you are free, Please let me know if you have any questions.

The stated purpose aligns with personal financial needs, and no indicators of ML or TF activity were detected. The client’s identity was verified through an Equifax report pulled on 2024-12-10, with a unique CID number provided, and her date of birth matched the records.\n\nRisk Level and Financial Background:\nThe client is assessed as medium to high risk due to a low credit score (below 500) with collections and charge-off accounts. While her boyfriend, who works in construction, employs her for admin/office work, her income is inconsistent, and she supplements it with side jobs. The property is located in a low-risk rural area, verified through satellite view and Google security checks. Bank statements have been requested to verify income and transactions before proceeding.\n\nDecision Not to Proceed:\nThe loan purpose and financial profile were reviewed. Additional documents are required before moving forward, and no suspicious indicators necessitating a report were found at this stage.\n\nConclusion:\nNo evidence of ML or TF activity was found, and a FINTRAC report was not required.","dateCreated":"2025-01-10T16:57:28.223"},{"text":"Selected Product: 1 year

The purpose of the loan is consistent with personal financial obligations. No indicators of ML or TF activity were detected at this stage.\n\nRisk Level and Financial Background:\nThe client is assessed as high risk due to a credit score below 500, being self-employed (BFS) as the owner of a catering company, and having collections and late payments. The period of financial strain resulted from being unable to work for six months. Bank statements have been requested to verify normal financial activity before determining if proceeding with the loan makes sense.\n\nDecision Not to Proceed:\nThe loan purpose and financial profile were reviewed. Additional documents, including bank statements, are required to confirm financial stability before any further action can be taken. No suspicious indicators necessitating a report were found at this stage.\n\nConclusion:\nNo evidence of ML or TF activity was found, and a FINTRAC report was not

As I had explained during our telephone conversation; in 2022 my mortgage was up for renewal and RBC didn't want to let me access any of the equity; I wanted to consolidate debt. I had some late payments with RBC; most of which were due to a clerical error by one of their staff and I couldn't reach her for weeks. I tried reaching out to others at RBC but they told me they couldn't help because the file was with this person. I spoke with multiple mortgage brokers who all were confident they could get me a mortgage with a B lender; however, after filling out multiple applications and paying for several appraisals I was still without a mortgage. I came across David Rebeck, he too felt that he could get me a mortgage with a B lender; I paid for another appraisal and in the end he couldn't get it done either but suggested I take a 2nd mortgage with him to pay off some debt; it wouldn't cover all. But, in 6 months time we would try again...I went ahead with this but in the 6 months time he couldn't get me a mortgage.  Now I'm in a situation where I am cash poor because I'm paying $1550/mth between the two mortgages plus I have $30,000 in debt that I'm making monthly payments on.  The payment on the 2nd mortgage is $816/mth and that's just interest (12%) on $70,000\n\nI owe my 2024 property taxes but I will pay those once I receive my retro pay which should be within the next couple of weeks; the employer has to have us paid by February 12th, 2025. Also at that time, my annual salary will increase as well, then another increase as of April 1, 2025 - this is in the documents I sent you.\n\nMy 2024 City of Winnipeg property assessment states $252,000. In 2022 the appraisals were $240,000.\n\nI would like to be able to consolidate everything into one payment and then do some upgrades on my home. Right now, the plan I have is to retire in 2028, sell my house and buy a little motorhome to travel around.\n\nI'm available for a phone call Jan 22 or 23 around 2pm CST.","dateCreated":"2025-01-20T13:44:09.373"},{"text":"capital one maybe , personal loans debts , forgot about staime","dateCreated":"2025-01-24T11:13:23.377"},{"text":"4 appraisal

Hi John, \n\nIt was great speaking with you earlier. As discussed, here are the details regarding your mortgage options:\nThis will be a two-step process:\nChallenges to consider:\nDue to a balance owed to the CRA, we're unable to offer options with A lenders, such as TD or Scotiabank and other A lenders.\nSince you're self-employed, lenders typically require a minimum of 12 months' worth of bank statements to verify your net income.\nT1 generals for the last 2 years for the A side\nIf we can provide 12 months of bank statements that match with your invoices, we can explore options with a B lender.\nB Lender Option:\nRates for B lenders start at 4.79% and may vary.\nTo qualify for this rate, you would need to show a minimum net income of $48,000 per year.\nAs mentioned, we will cover the cost of the appraisal if you decide to move forward with this transaction.\nPlease note: All offers are subject to change and approval.\nAdditionally, there are certain fees associated with mortgage transactions that we didn’t cover over the phone:\n1% Lender Fee\n1-2% Broker Fee\nAppraisal Fee (minimum $425)\nBlue Pearl Admin Fee: $500\nLegal Fees (Do you have a lawyer in mind?)\nIf we secure a B lender approval, legal fees will depend on the lawyer you choose, typically around $1,500 (could be more or less).\nFor a private lender approval, there will be two sets of legal fees, approximately $1,500 each.\nAll fees will be deducted from the proceeds, you will not pay any fees out of pocket.   \n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like to proceed. I’m looking forward to building a lasting relationship with you, John.\n\n\nHave a great weekend, and I’ll touch base with you on Monday.","dateCreated":"2025-01-10T10:07:29.607"},{"text":"1. both

 \nHi Stephanie,  \n\nI had not a bad weekend.  Hope your feeling better.\n\nI was just reviewing with Gene.  I'm not sure how to get the additional amount we need to make this work.\n\nThe loan value over both properties needs to be at 65%, and we can only seem to get 50-55%.-   It's tough to get 65% based on your current situation and there is a foreclosure involved. \n\nI thought maybe a second work.  But the feed back I'm getting is a private lender will not go behind another private lender.  yes this is correct,  Most privates lenders don't like going behind another private lender.    It's too high risk.   Sarah, if you are working with another broker, I don't want to interfere with any chance of your approval or waste anymore of your time.   Most of us work with the same lenders and as much as I want to continue to work with you, the best that I can do was the approval I sent you.        \n\nSo, we are still needing another 93k with taking your offer.    Yes, if you are still needing the extra funds.  \n\nAny other ideas on your end?
