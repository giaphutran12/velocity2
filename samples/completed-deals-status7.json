Each file is unique, and approvals can vary depending on several factors. While I can submit your file to the lender I believe is best positioned to get you approved, I can’t dictate how fast that approval comes through.\nPushing the process—on either end—won’t benefit either of us and could potentially work against us. Please know that I’m actively working on your file and doing everything I can to move things forward.

The estimated interest rate would range between 9% and 12%.\nOne of the key advantages of a line of credit is that you only pay interest on the amount you actually use, not the full approved limit.\nEstimated Monthly Interest-Only Payments:\n\n?\nAmount Used\n9% Interest\n10% Interest\n11% Interest\n12% Interest\n$50,000\n$375.00\n$416.67\n$458.33\n$500.00\n$60,000\n$450.00\n$500.00\n$550.00\n$600.00\nPlease note: These figures are rough estimates and are subject to change. We will need to complete a formal appraisal of the property before moving forward and confirming the final numbers.\nAdditionally, broker fees, lender fees, and legal fees will be deducted from the proceeds of the line of credit.\n\n\n\n\nGarry(Gurkirat Singh)\nMortgage Broker\n\np: 604.372.2764 EXT- 800 \np: Calgary 587.352.2764 EXT-800 \ntoll free: 1.800.288.2764 \nf: 1.800.598.BPMG (2764)\ne: garry@bluepearlmortgage.ca  \n0: Unit 200 5570 152 Street Surrey, BC V3S 5J9\nwww.bluepearlmortgage.ca\n\nfacebooktwitterinstagramlinkedin\n\n\nNote: The information contained in this message and or attachments is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.
